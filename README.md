# Carbon Weighted Traffic Control — Project Website

This is a small React + Vite site scaffold to showcase the Carbon Weighted Traffic Control senior project.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:/Documents/Projects/Senior-Project-Website"
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Place your demo video at `public/assets/demo-video.mp4` to have it used in the Gallery video placeholder. Replace the placeholder images in `src/App.jsx` with your own images or point them to `public/assets/` files.

Notable files:
- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry
- `src/App.jsx` — main UI with team, gallery, and placeholders
- `src/styles.css` — project styles

If you want me to install dependencies, run the dev server, or add additional pages (e.g., simulation screenshots or an analytics dashboard), tell me and I can continue.
